@model Mvc3Examples.Models.StudentViewModel

    ViewBag.Title = "Required";
}

<h2>Required Data Annotation Example</h2>

<p>This example generates HTML form that maps the model attributes to Label, Editor, and ValidationMessage methods.
    <pre class="prettyprint">
        Html.EditorFor(model => model.Name) resolves to @Html.Encode(@Html.EditorForModel())
    </pre>
</p>

<p>If you do not enter anything in the textbox, the value will be passed back to the backend, 
    at which point model will run through a set of validations.  One of the validations will be Required, which 
    will fail in this scenario.  You can check ModelState.IsValid to see whether the object is valid or not.
    You can also check ModelState.Values collection.  This collection may contain Errors list, which will specify which ErrorMessage
    was thrown.  This error message can be overwritten in the Required constructor as such:
    <pre class="prettyprint">
        [Require(ErrorMessage="this is the real error")]
    </pre>

    The key that has the error message maps to the id of the HTML element where the required parameter was set to.  
    Html.ValidationMessageFor(model => model.Name) will then take that error message and output it.
</p>

@Html.Partial("StudentViewModel", Model)
